They began playing for Le Club Musicale Literaire, and after adding more members, became The Mountain Dews. Their repertoire includes western and bluegrass music. Bill first heard a bass washtub on the Ted Mack Amateur Radio Hour. He figured out how to make one and how to play it. Bill was 12 when he got together with a group of neighborhood friends playing guitar, harmonica, and washboard. Their gigs included bean suppers in church basements. Other members of the Mountain Dews have been Roland Boileau, Ray Chouinard, Bob Boothbay, Bill Anctil and Pauline St. Denis."
